        "# Adaptive Per-Head KV Cache Compression Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `AdaptivePerHeadPress` to apply learned per-layer per-head compression strategies to KV cache compression.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of using a fixed compression ratio for all layers and heads, `AdaptivePerHeadPress` uses a trained policy network to dynamically allocate different compression budgets to each layer and attention head based on their KV cache statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Train a policy network using the code in `policy/` directory\n",
        "2. Save the checkpoint (e.g., `ckpts/policy/policy_epoch10.pt`)\n",
        "3. Load the checkpoint in this wrapper\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adaptive**: Different heads get different compression ratios based on learned importance\n",
        "- **Flexible**: Works with any `ScorerPress`-based compression method\n",
        "- **Efficient**: Policy network runs only once during prefill, minimal overhead\n"
